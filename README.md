# Digits

Used scikit-learn's bundled Digits and Keras's bundled MNIST digits dataset to learn Machine Learning and Deep Learning

Tools: Keras, TensorFlow, TensorBoard, Python libraries (pandas, Matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn)

**Classification (supervised ML)**
- Used k-nearest neighbours algorithm to predict handwritten digits

**Clustering (unsupervised ML)**
- Performed dimensionality reduction using TSNE estimator

**Convolutional Neural Network (DL)**
- Performed probabilistic classification to train and test a model that predicts handwritten digits
